What shall we do with a drunken student?
What shall we do with a drunken student?
What shall we do with a drunken student?
Early in the morning!

Way hay and up he rises [x3]
Early in the morning!

Take him to Klusteri until 7...
Take him to the morning lecture...
Wake him up with a glass of vodka...
Thatâ€™s what we do with a drunken student...
