TROGDOR!
TROGDOR!

Trogdor was a man!
I mean, he was a dragon-man
Or maybe he was just a dragon...
But he was still

TROGDOR!
TROGDOR!

Burninating the countryside
Burninating the peasants
Burninating all the peoples
And their thatched-roof cottages!
Thatched-roof cottages!

Whoa! Listen to those wicked dueling guitar solos! 
It's like Squeedly vs. Meedly over here. Go squeedly! 
Go squeedly! Squeedly wins!

When all the land is in ruin
And burnination has forsaken the countryside
Only one guy will remain
My money's on...

TROGDOR!
TROGDOR!
And the Trogdor comes in the night!
