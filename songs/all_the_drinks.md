All the drinks are going down,
going down, going down.
All the drinks are going down,
to my stomach!

All the drinks are coming up,
coming up, coming up.
All the drinks are coming up,
from my stomach!

Freshers will be cleaning up,
cleaning up, cleaning up,
freshers will be cleaning up,
once I pass out!
