Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way</p>
<p>I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way</p>
<p>Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?</p>
<p>:,: Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe? :,:</p>
<p>You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way</p>
<p>I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way</p>
<p>Your stare was holding ...
Hey, I just met you ...</p>
<p>Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that</p>
<p>I missed you so, so bad, bad, bad, bad ...</p>
<p>It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?</p>
<p>Hey, I just met you ...</p>
<p>Before you came into my life ...</p>
<p>So call me, maybe?</p>
