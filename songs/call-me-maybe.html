Don&#x27;t ask me, I&#x27;ll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you&#x27;re in my way

I&#x27;d trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn&#x27;t looking for this
But now you&#x27;re in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you&#x27;re going, baby?

:,: Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here&#x27;s my number
So call me, maybe?
It&#x27;s hard to look right
At you baby
But here&#x27;s my number
So call me, maybe? :,:

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you&#x27;re in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it&#x27;s real
I didn&#x27;t know I would feel it
But it&#x27;s in my way

Your stare was holding ...
Hey, I just met you ...

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that

I missed you so, so bad, bad, bad, bad ...

It&#x27;s hard to look right
At you baby
But here&#x27;s my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you ...

Before you came into my life ...

So call me, maybe?
