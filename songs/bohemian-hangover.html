Rhapsody</em><div class="markdown_markdown__34PyV"><p>Is this the morning after?
What happened yesterday?
Caught in hangover,
no escape from reality.</p>
<p>Open my eyes,
feel the pain in my head
and scream.
I’m just a student.
I need your sympathy
because I’m easy come, easy go,
a little high, little low.
Any type of alcohol,
doesn’t really matter to me, to me.</p>
<p>Mama, just please be here.
Put a meal aside my bed.
Pull a pork and a slice of bread.
Mama, day had just begun.
But now I’ve gone and
thrown it all away.</p>
<p>Mama, ooo,
didn’t mean to drink that much.
If I’m not well again this time tomorrow
drink some more, drink some more
as if nothing really matters.</p>
<p>Too late, my time has come.
Declining invites in my head.
Cell phone’s ringing all the time.
Fuck you everybody, I’ve got to stay.
Gotta fade you all behind
and face the truth.</p>
<p>Mama, ooo.
I don’t want to die.
I sometimes wish
I’d never been born at all.</p>
<p>I see a little shot glass with some vodka.
Scaramouch, Scaramouch,
With some Absolut vodka.
Thunderbolt and lightning,
very, very charming me.
Shot of vodka, shot of vodka,
shot of vodka, shot of vodka,
shot of vodka down my throat – magnifico.</p>
<p>But I’m just a student and nobody loves me.
He’s just a student from a poor family.
Spare him his life from this monstrosity</p>
<p>Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah no! We will not let you go. (let him go)
:,: Bismillah! We will not let you go. (let him go) :,:
Will not let you go. (let me go)
Will not let you go. (never, never, never let me
go)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh mamma mia, mamma mia,
mamma mia let me go.
In Old Irish Pub
there’s a beer put aside
for me, for me, for me.</p>
<p>So you think I’ll just stay home and start to cry?
So you think I’ll stay sober until I die?
Oh baby, can’t do this to me baby.
Just gotta get out,
just gotta get right outta here.</p>
<p>Nothing really matters.
Anyone can see.
Nothing really matters.
Nothing really matters to me.</p>
