That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now</p>
<p>Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now</p>
<p>And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how</p>
<p>Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall</p>
<p>Today was gonna be the day ...</p>
