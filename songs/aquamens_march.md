title: Aquamen's march
---

God forbid that we should ever take a sip
of that vile, unholy drink
that has alcohol within
When you smell the breath of any one of us
youâ€™ll find that we are pure!

Hurrah, we're young and free, we're aquamen
'Cause the best hangover cure, is when you
don't drink at all
Hurrah, we're young and free, we're aquamen
We'll stay sober 'till the end! (Oh yes)

Oh you used to hide away inside your room,
isolated from the world, always studying like a
nerd,
now you take a giant swig out of your glass,
let everyone rejoice!

Hurrah, we're young and free, we're aquamen
'Cause the best hangover cure, is when you
don't drink at all
Hurrah, we're young and free, we're aquamen
We'll stay sober 'till the end! (Oh yes)
