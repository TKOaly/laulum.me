I heard there was a single star
That shines so brightly from afar
The evening young
The party just beginning
We came up to the open doors
The tables set on the party floors
Now in the glasses pour the Jaloviina

Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina

This seems familiar, let me think
I’ve sung these songs and I’ve drunk this drink
I used to sing alone before I came here
I turn my head to left to right
My comrades are a joyful sight
So in our glasses raise the Jaloviina

Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina

It’s late but not yet time for bed
You gently rest your weary head
And close your eyes as dreams they overcome you
Your comrades hear you loudly snore
Decide that they can take no more
So on your lips they pour the Jaloviina
