I'm sitting here on the bathroom floor.
I’m drunk and fat and my head is sore.
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to drink.
I'm sobering up and I'm starting to think
that nothing ever happens
when I’m sober.

Two days ago I went to bar.
My constant thirst is taking me far.
I'd like to change my point of view.
I feel so thirsty, I'm waiting for you.
But nothing ever happens
when I’m sober.

I wonder how, I wonder why
yesterday you found me
in the open bar
and all that I can see
is just another Salmari.

It’s spinning my head up and down,
spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning around
and all that I can see
is just another Salmari.

I'm sitting here, I miss the booze.
I'd like to go out, taking a shower
but there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
where nothing ever happens
when I’m sober.

Empty bottle is not good for me.
Empty bottle, I don't want to live without Salmari.
I'm sad and crying ‘cause Alko is closed.
Thinking how to get myself a little buzzed.
Cause nothing ever happens
when I’m sober.

I wonder how, I wonder why
yesterday you found me
in the open bar
and all that I can see
is just another Salmari.

It’s spinning my head up and down,
spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning around
and all that I can see
is just another Salmari.
