There once was a drink that topped all drinks.
The name of the drink still a mystery.
The crew stood up; their food wolfed down.
Oh my, what a good drink, wow. (huh)

Soon may the secret be out
to bring us peace and joy and fun.
One day, when the party is done,
we’ll take our drinks and go.

There once was a drink that topped all drinks.
The name of the drink was _______________.
`[fill in your fave]`
The gang cheered up, all strife cooled down.
Oh my, what a good choice, wow. (huh)

Now may the secret be out
to bring me peace and joy and fun.
One day, when the party is done,
we’ll take our drinks and go.
