I'm making a note here:
Huge success!</p>
<p>It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.</p>
<p>Aperture Science:
We do what we must
because we can
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.</p>
<p>But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
'til you run out of cake.
And the science gets done.
And you make a neat gun
for the people who are
still alive.</p>
<p>I'm not even angry...
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart,
and killed me.</p>
<p>And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!</p>
<p>Now, these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time!
So I'm GLaD I got burned!
Think of all the things we learned!
for the people who are
still alive.</p>
<p>Go ahead and leave me...
I think I'd prefer to stay inside...
Maybe you'll find someone else
to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance!</p>
<p>Anyway this cake is great!
It's so delicious and moist!</p>
<p>Look at me: still talking
when there's science to do!
When I look out there,
it makes me glad I'm not you.</p>
<p>I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are
still alive.
And believe me I am
still alive.
I'm doing science and I'm
still alive.
I feel fantastic and I'm
still alive.
While you're dying I'll be
still alive.
And when you're dead I will be
still alive</p>
<p>Still alive.</p>
<p>Still alive.</p>
