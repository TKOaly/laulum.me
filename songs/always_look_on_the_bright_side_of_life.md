title: Always Look on the Bright Side of Life
melody: Monty Python

Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble give a whistle
This will help things turn out for the best ...

And ... Always look on the bright side of life ...
Always look on the light side of life ...

If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly, chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing

And ... always look on the bright side of life ...
Always look on the light side of life ...

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow.
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.

So, always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's the joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

Always look on the bright side of life ...
And always look on the right side of life ...
(Come on guys, cheer up!)
Always look on the bright side of life ...
And always look on the right side of life ...
(Worse things happen at sea, you know.)
Always look on the bright side of life ...
(I mean - what have you got to lose?)
(You know, you come from nothing -
you're going back to nothing.
What have you lost? Nothing!)
Always look on the right side of life ...
