title: Indian moon
---

Indian moon is so scorching hot
oo-hiio-hei!
Next to it sun is small as a dot
oo-hiio-hei!
And one day it set my hat in flames
oo-hiio-hei!
It burned my hair and cooked my brains
oo-hiio-hei!

:,:Just tell us your tales.
You’ve lived your life in sails.
And even if you swear they’re lies,
We trust you, you’re so wise.
Hei juttele sinä vaan, kyllä sinut tunnetaan
ja vaikka sen valheeksi vannotkin
niin kyllä sua uskotaan.:,:

The birds over there were fried mid-flight
And houses kept melting, it was a blight
And every fish we caught from the sea
Was crisp and salted all for free.

Just tell us your tales....

We lift our anchors from India
Red Sea we reach through Siberia
From there we headed towards Siam,
but our ship was stuck in strawberry jam.

Just tell us your tales....

As we were sailing through the Nile
we spotted a hungry crocodile
The mummies living their life in peace
wanted one sailor to marry their niece.

Just tell us your tales....

And there on top of a pyramid
stood a lighthouse with a pub in it
There they served warm drinks on sand
The pharaohs danced the nights on end

Just tell us your tales...

(make up your own bs verse)
