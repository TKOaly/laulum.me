title: Program in C
melody: Under the Sea

The syntax might seem much sweeter
where objects and subtypes play.
But frills like inheritance
will only get in the way!
Admire C’s simple landscape;
efficiently dangerous!
No templates or fancy pitfalls
like Java or C++.

Program in C.
Program in C.

Pointers, assembly,
manage your memory
with malloc() and free()!
Don’t sink your app with runtime bloat.
Software with C will stay afloat.
Do what you want here
close to the hardware.

Program in C!
