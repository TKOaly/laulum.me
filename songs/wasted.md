:,: Wasted, wa-wa-wa-wasted, 
wa-wa-wawasted, we're gonna get :,:

First I will drink down two bottles of sparkling
wine,
Which gets me feeling more than fine
And then a barrel of whisky rye is all I need
To finally get me up to running speed

:,: Wasted, wa-wa-wa-wasted,
wa-wa-wawasted, we're gonna get :,:

(The Empire strikes back!)
Hang-hang-hang-hangover, hangover
Hang-hang-hang-hangover, hangover
Hang-hang-hang-hang-hang-hangoverha-hang-hang-ha-hangover-ha-hang-hangoverhangover
