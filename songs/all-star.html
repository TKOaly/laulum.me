I ain&#x27;t the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an &quot;L&quot; on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don&#x27;t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn&#x27;t make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what&#x27;s wrong with taking the back streets?
You&#x27;ll never know if you don&#x27;t go
You&#x27;ll never shine if you don&#x27;t glow

Hey, now, you&#x27;re an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you&#x27;re a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It&#x27;s a cool place and they say it gets colder
You&#x27;re bundled up now wait &#x27;til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water&#x27;s getting warm so you might as well swim
My world&#x27;s on fire. How about yours?
That&#x27;s the way I like it and I&#x27;ll never get bored

Hey, now, you&#x27;re an all-star ...
Hey, now, you&#x27;re an all-star ...
