title: Pope and sultan
---

The Pope he leads a jolly life,
He’s free from every care and strife;
:,: He drinks the best of Rhenish wine,
I would the Pope’s gay life were mine. :,:

But he don’t lead a jolly life,
He has no maid or blooming wife,
:,: He has no son to raise his hope,
Oh! I would not be the Pope. :,:

The Sultan better pleases me,
His life is full of jolity,
:,: He’s wives as many as he will,
I fain the Sultan’s throne would fill. :,:

But still he is a wretched man,
He must obey the Al-Koran,
:,: He dare not drink one drop of wine,
I would not change his lot for mine. :,:

So when the maiden kisses me,
I’ll think that I the Sultan be,
:,: And when my Rhenish wine I tope,
Oh then I’ll think that I’m the Pope. :,:

Oh I dont want to be alone (be alone)
On Pope's or Sultan's useful throne
But I will take my turn to be of use
and walk a mile in their shoes
