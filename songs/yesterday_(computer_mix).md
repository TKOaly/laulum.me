Yesterday,
all those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
there's not half the files there used to be,
and there's a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.

I pushed something wrong,
what it was, I couldn't say.
Now all my data's gone,
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
the need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay.
Now I believe in yesterday.
