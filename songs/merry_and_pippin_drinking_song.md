title: Merry & Pippin drinking song

Hey! Ho! To the bottle I go,
to heal my heart and drown my woe.
Rain may fall and wind may blow,
but there still be many miles to go.

Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain,
and the stream that falls from hill to plain.
Better than rain or rippling brook...
is a mug of beer inside this Took!
