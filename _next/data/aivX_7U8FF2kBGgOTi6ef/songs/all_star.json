{"pageProps":{"song":{"title":"All Star","melody":"Smash Mouth - All Star","lyrics":"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\nI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed\nShe was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\nIn the shape of an \"L\" on her forehead\n\nWell, the years start coming and they don't stop coming\nFed to the rules and I hit the ground running\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\nSo much to do, so much to see\nSo what's wrong with taking the back streets?\nYou'll never know if you don't go\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\n\nHey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play\nHey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid\nAnd all that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold\n\nIt's a cool place and they say it gets colder\nYou're bundled up now wait 'til you get older\nBut the meteor men beg to differ\nJudging by the hole in the satellite picture\nThe ice we skate is getting pretty thin\nThe water's getting warm so you might as well swim\nMy world's on fire. How about yours?\nThat's the way I like it and I'll never get bored\n\nHey, now, you're an all-star ...\nHey, now, you're an all-star ...\n","slug":"all_star"}},"__N_SSG":true}
