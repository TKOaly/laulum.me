Tolkien]\nFar over the Misty Mountains cold\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old\nWe must away, ere break of day\nTo seek our pale enchanted gold\n\nThe dwarves of yore made mighty spells\nWhile hammers fell like ringing bells\nIn places deep, where dark things sleep\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells\n\nFor ancient king and elvish lord\nThere many a gleaming golden hoard\nThey shaped and wrought, and light they caught\nTo hide in gems on hilt of sword\n\nOn silver necklaces they strung\nThe flowering stars, on crowns they hung\nThe dragon-fire, on twisted wire\nThey meshed the light of moon and sun\n\nFar over the Misty Mountains cold\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old\nWe must away, ere break of day\nTo claim our long-forgotten gold\n\nGoblets they carved there for themselves\nAnd harps of gold, where no man delves\nThere lay they long, and many a song\nWas sung unheard by men or elves\nThe pines were roaring on the heights\nThe wind was moaning in the night\nThe fire was red, it flaming spread\nThe trees like torches blazed with light\n\nThe bells were ringing in the dale\nAnd men looked up with faces pale\nThe dragon's ire, more fierce than fire\nLaid low their towers and houses frail\n\nThe mountain smoked beneath the moon\nThe dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom\nThey fled the hall to dying fall\nBeneath his feet, beneath the moon\n\nFar over the Misty Mountains grim\nTo dungeons deep and caverns dim\nWe must away, ere break of day\nTo win our harps and gold from him!\n\nThe wind was on the withered heath\nBut in the forest stirred no leaf\nThere shadows lay be night or day\nAnd dark things silent crept beneath\n\nThe wind came down from mountains cold\nAnd like a tide it roared and rolled\nThe branches groaned, the forest moaned\nAnd leaves were laid upon the mould\nThe wind went on from West to East;\nAll movement in the forest ceased\nBut shrill and harsh across the marsh\nIts whistling voices were released\n\nThe grasses hissed, their tassels bent\nThe reeds were rattling--on it went\nO'er shaken pool under heavens cool\nWhere racing clouds were torn and rent\n\nIt passed the Lonely Mountain bare\nAnd swept above the dragon's lair\nThere black and dark lay boulders stark\nAnd flying smoke was in the air\n\nIt left the world and took its flight\nOver the wide seas of the night\nThe moon set sail upon the gale\nAnd stars were fanned to leaping light\n\nUnder the Mountain dark and tall\nThe King has come unto his hall!\nHis foe is dead, the Worm of Dread\nAnd ever so his foes shall fall!\n\nThe sword is sharp, the spear is long\nThe arrow swift, the Gate is strong\nThe heart is bold that looks on gold\nThe dwarves no more shall suffer wrong\nThe dwarves of yore made mighty spells\nWhile hammers fell like ringing bells\nIn places deep, where dark things sleep\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells\n\nOn silver necklaces they strung\nThe light of stars, on crowns they hung\nThe dragon-fire, from twisted wire\nThe melody of harps they wrung\n\nThe mountain throne once more is freed!\nO! Wandering folk, the summons heed!\nCome haste! Come haste! Across the waste!\nThe king of friend and kin has need\n\nNow call we over the mountains cold\n'Come back unto the caverns old!\nHere at the gates the king awaits\nHis hands are rich with gems and gold\n\nThe king has come unto his hall\nUnder the Mountain dark and tall\nThe Wyrm of Dread is slain and dead\nAnd ever so our foes shall fall\n\nFarewell we call to hearth and hall!\nThough wind may blow and rain may fall\nWe must away, ere break of day\nFar over the wood and mountain tall\n\nTo Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell\nIn glades beneath the misty fell\nThrough moor and waste we ride in haste\nAnd whither then we cannot tell\n\nWith foes ahead, behind us dread\nBeneath the sky shall be our bed\nUntil at last our toil be passed\nOur journey done, our errand sped\n\nWe must away! We must away!\nWe ride before the break of day!\n","slug":"far-over-the-misty-mountains-cold"}},"__N_SSG":true}
