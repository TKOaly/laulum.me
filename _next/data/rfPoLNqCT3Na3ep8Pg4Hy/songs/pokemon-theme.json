{"pageProps":{"song":{"title":"Pokémon Theme","lyrics":"I wanna be the very best\nLike no one ever was\nTo catch them is my real test\nTo train them is my cause\n\nI will travel across the land\nSearching far and wide\nTeach Pokémon to understand\nThe power that's inside\n\nPokémon! Gotta catch 'em all (it's you and me)\nI know it's my destiny\nPokémon! Oh, you're my best friend\nIn a world we must defend\n\nPokémon! Gotta catch 'em all (a heart so true)\nOur courage will pull us through\nYou teach me and I'll teach you\nPokémon! \nGotta catch 'em all\nGotta catch 'em all\nPokémon!\n\n\n-- Not included in the song book --\n\nEvery challenge along the way\nWith courage I will face\nI will battle every day\nTo claim my rightful place\n\nCome with me, the time is right\nThere's no better team\nArm in arm, we'll win the fight\nIt's always been our dream\n\nPokémon! Gotta catch 'em all (it's you and me)\nI know it's my destiny\nPokémon! Oh, you're my best friend\nIn a world we must defend\n\nPokémon! Gotta catch 'em all (a heart so true)\nOur courage will pull us through\nYou teach me and I'll teach you\nPokémon! \n\n(repeat n amount of times)\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
