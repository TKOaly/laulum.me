> [!NOTE]
> Please create a **separate pull request** for each song.  
> This way the entire suite of songs is not rejected due to singular mistakes.

Song lyrics are stored in the `songs/` directory.  
If you want to add a song, create a new file in the directory with the song lyrics in it.

You'll also need to add a header, containing at least a title for the song:

```
---
title: Song title
---

Song lyrics...
```

You can also specify the melody and/or writers, as well as tags:

```
---
title: Gurulassa
melody: Anssi Kela - Puistossa
writers: Ada
tags: finnish,medium
---

Gurulassa ilta viilenee.
Topi l채mpimikseen koodailee...
```

Tags are to be specified as comma-separated values without spaces in between (see above example). If you want to add a tag, append it to `staticData.json`.

The currently available tags are `finnish,english,estonian,swedish,german,short,medium,long,very long,kerava,drinking,water,jaloviina,wine,high abv,low abv,any drink`

### Books (WIP)

> [!NOTE]
> Books should be their separate pull requests.  
> If you're adding new songs alongside a book, please create **separate pull requests** for the songs.  
> One-off songs can be added directly in the book file using the `content` field.

Books can be added as JSON files in the `books` folder. See [`books/tekis-2017.json`](/books/tekis-2017.json) for reference.

Books can be linked using their filename, e.g. `tekis-2017.json` matches https://laulum.me/books/tekis-2017.

**Format**

```js
{
  "title": "Title of the book",

  "credits": {

      "number": "32",
      // Automatically links to laulum.me song if title matches.
      "title": "Song name",
      // Can be left out. Overrides everything and shows just this content alongside number and title.
      "content": "Custom content",
      // Can be left out. Manually specifies laulum.me song slug to link to.
      "slug": "song-slug"
    }
  ]
}
